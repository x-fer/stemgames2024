First fix .png file with hex editor. Extract archive from both files. One archive is encrypted and another one is not. Extract unencrypted archive and decode morse code from it. There is phone code and call it. Person from other side will tell you password for an archive. In other archive is obfuscated person's face, find that person onsite and he will tell you a flag.
